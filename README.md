The Merchant:
A merchant can place 8 large boxes or 10 small boxes into a carton for shipping. In one shipment, he sent a total of 178 boxes. If he ships more large boxes than small (the difference is exactly 2), how many large and how many small boxes can he ship? 
You may find your answer on the page(#large boxes) and in the row(#small boxes). ;)
